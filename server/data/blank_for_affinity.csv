We deploy temporary, autonomous servers (TAS), on-demand, and at random IP addresses, which are destroyed after use, thereby reducing the risk present in static servers. Permanent server resources are subject to continuous risk as a broad attack surface. The Solution transitions an organization, in the course of a week or weeks, from managing static server resources to commanding server resources on-demand. Deploying limited-purpose temporary servers with only instance-relevant software modules reduces dramatically the attack surface as well as the window of opportunity by exposing resources only as long as necessary (e.g., per instance, per login). Following deployment (e.g., per instance, per login) the temporary server is destroyed. These organizational changes ensure computing resources are now ephemeral, responsive and on-demand. Using on-demand servers with fresh software sourced from a golden image, and auditing utilities within the existing cybersecurity environment ensures that authorized activity is controlled and carefully circumscribed. This on-demand environment enhances speed and surety of forensic investigations, and helps ensure compliance with regulatory and security protocols.  Access to the server is reduced to only the parties authorized and authenticated to the instance. In other words, there is no server administrator, super-user access or any other logical access control vulnerabilities, which are all necessary evils to manage and optimize static servers (e.g., repeated patches to stale software).

Mindpass is a ground-breaking innovation that replaces standard password authentication, bringing significant gains in memorability and exponential improvement in security. To authenticate using Mindpass, users simply navigate and select four items from a virtual 3D environment, similar to a basic video game. User interface is intuitive, and authentication takes no longer than entering, let alone recalling, a traditional password. The Mindpass 3D spatial authentication window can be integrated with almost any electronic authentication interface. Security issues are the most significant impediment to efficient use of the internet. Cyber-security breaches cost enterprises an average of $6.1M per breach. 74% of these breaches are due to weak passwords, and 1/3 of all e-commerce is lost because of forgotten passwords (BDO Cyber Governance Survey). While numerous attempts have been made to increase security via password protocols, users routinely circumvent them, sacrificing password security to gain memorability. The average U.S. adult has 100+ passwords, and they are a significant pain point. Existing password managers have tapped only 3% of the available market and are a partial solution at best. Mindpass has the opportunity to transform the authentication experience for all computer users. Near-term, Mindpass will focus on enterprise clients. Mindpass has discovered numerous businesses in which cyber security is a major corporate headache. Especially in industries which operate on sensitive information and trade secrets, protecting data is a struggle. Often, employees of such enterprises forget passwords and fall victim to password recovery phishing, exposing vast amounts of corporate data. Password management software helps mitigate these risks, but its involved installation and strict recommendations deter users. Mindpass enterprise authentication combines passive user flow with security and memorability, no installation necessary. Mindpass plans to first target areas with the most sensitive information, such as the medical and financial industries. By increasing security in such enterprises, Mindpass will not only alleviate corporate headaches but also create positive societal impact for consumers whose private data is so often compromised by breaches. While traditional password security is inversely proportional to memorability, Mindpass provides concurrent gains in both domains. A variety of research generally supports the notion that human memory is superior when information is introduced visually rather than alphanumerically‚Äîwhile humanity has evolved to adeptly navigate spatial environments since its inception, alphanumeric and even linguistic sequences are a relatively recent innovation and thus remembered poorly. Mindpass capitalizes on the superiority of human visual and spatial memory by shifting authentication into a visually-dominant environment. With Mindpass, remembering your password is as easy as remembering where four items are in your house. Mindpass will comprehensively address the pain points of both low password security and password memory difficulties for authentication users.",,,,,In Contact

The seed was planted right then. In May 2016, after months of deliberations, the foundations of this unconventional venture were laid by the three mavericks. It was christened Bhujang, the Sanskrit word for serpent. In Indian mythology, this nimble but ferocious creature was often seen guarding access to treasures.
