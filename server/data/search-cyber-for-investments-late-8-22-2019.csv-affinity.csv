FRISS (www.friss.com) offers a complete solution for fraud, risk and compliance.  ☆ Risk assessment at underwriting ☆ Generate profitable growth for your portfolio by real-time automated detection and assessment of risks during the underwriting process. It is important to prevent fraud and assess risks by having a holistic view of prospects before they enter your portfolio. The FRISS underwriting solution provides an intelligent and uniform risk estimation, which is proven to improve the combined ratio significantly. ☆ Prevent and detect fraud at claims ☆ The general assumption is that, at average, around 10% of all Insurance Claims are tied to some sort of fraud. In order to finance these malicious claims, we all pay additional for our Insurance Policies. Three things are important: - How to detect fraud correctly and efficiently? - How to detect malicious customers in time? - How do you handle this in your daily operational business? Reduce your loss ratio by increasing the chances of detecting fraud and limit false positives to a minimum. Use automated fraud detection during the claims process to make an accurate and objective estimation of the risks related to a claim. It improves straight through processing (STP), and claims that need further attention will be recognized directly. ☆ Become and stay compliant ☆ Compliance concerns all insurance processes. Become and stay compliant with the latest legislation and regulations. Knowing and screening your customers will prevent reputational damage and avoids high penalties. Gain insight into Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs). This will enhance the quality of your underwriting process. Furthermore, administrative burdens will be reduced to a minimum.

Machine learning is used to immediately and accurately identify compromised credentials and database attacks. Customers gain insights and a situational awareness of IT infrastructure including four primary benefits:     * Non-intrusively and continuously discovering all databases     * Deep analysis into database activity     * Pinpoint insider threats     * Artificial intelligence identifies insider threats DB Networks continuous database infrastructure monitoring ""shines a light"" on what's really going on in your infrastructure. For example, undocumented and unmanaged databases may contain highly sensitive information and offer cyber attackers an enormously large attack surface. DB Networks non-intrusively discovers all databases and the interactions of users and applications to their connected databases. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) operating inside the core network introduce new, or alter user/application interactions. DB Networks maps all of these application interactions to rapidly identify APTs. Continuous monitoring the core network also identifies policy violations such as restricted databases being exposed to unrestricted network segments. DB Networks’ unique approach to intelligent database security utilizes machine learning and behavioral analysis to automatically create models of each applications proper interactions with their connected databases. These models are used to immediately and accurately identify database attacks. With no signature files to deal with or endless false positives to chase down operational support of DB Networks products becomes trivial.
